Purpose
Script to easily and quickly stop frequently used programs.
This can be used when you are not able to stop program via Windows GUI (for example, program is not responding).
Also this can be used to stop multiple instances of program at once instead of stop instances one by one (stop one by one is very routine operation if you have a lot of program copies opened)
